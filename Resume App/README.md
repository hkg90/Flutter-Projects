# Project 3: Resume-type application
* Displays three tabs, consisting of icons, at the top area of the screen.
* Layout is responsive enough to look good and be usable in any orientation (ie images scale, no screen overflow, styled uniquely, etc.).

1. The Business Card tab displays a photo, name, title, phone number, web site url (e.g., GitHub profile), and email address.
  * Tapping the phone number, the device's text messaging app should appear.
  * Tapping the web site url makes web broswer open and displays GitHub web page.

2. The Resume tab displays scrollable list of prior work experience (challenge: create scrollable list without using ListView widget).

3. Predictor tab should exhibits behavior similar to a "magic eight ball" and playfully predicts whether or not you will get called back after an interview.
  * Tapping on Text widget causes the screen to display a new random answer.

**To run app, use VSC to run flutter project with virtual device simulator (I used a Pixel 4 emulator).**
